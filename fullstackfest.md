# Full Stack Fest 2018

From September 2nd till September 8th I had the opportunity to attend, enjoy and ingest [Full Stack Fest 2018 Barcelona](https://2018.fullstackfest.com/),
a week-long, language agnostic, full stack development conference with a focus on what's coming next and inspiring perspectives.

I won't go into a deep, detailed descroption here - the videos of all the talks will be available soon, however here are my thoughts on the Conference, Barcelona and a few other things too.

First of all we would like to thank [Luca Marchesini](https://twitter.com/xbill82) for hosting the sessions.

## General Thoughts

Barcelona is a city I had visited once before years ago and I'd been looking for excuses to visit - so a tech conference in a city I loved was the ideal opportunity!. 

I'd never attended a multi-day tech conference before, and never one with such a multi-cultural feel (Europeans, Americans, Asian presenters and attendees - truly a global reach).

It was an inclusive conference - I was impressed by the live captioning coming from a US based stenographer! (Link here to details)

### Software Engineering - A philosophical activity

Tom Enden ([@tom_enden](https://twitter.com/tom_enden)): Did you know that Plato invented OOP and the Prototype pattern is inspired by Nominalism which also dates back to Plato. Tom showed the parallels between philosophy and software engineering. According the pragmatic programmer we should learn at least one language every year. Since different languages solved things in different ways. And Tractatus says the limits of my language means the limit of the world. So looking on philosophy we can inspire our selves for new ideas.

### Lightning talks
Antiona Librada ([@antoniolibrada](https://twitter.com/antoniolibrada)) showed us how he improved a complex ci build pipeline which took > 45 minutes to run by using 2 lambdas and Amazon Code Build. The outcome was a more stable, cheaper and faster build pipeline. They increased the number of daily deployments drastically.

Peter van der Meulen ([@HendrikPetertje](https://twitter.com/HendrikPetertje)) showed us his terminal. This shows again how important improving your daily workflow is. Some highights: Spotify in Vim, thefuck, circleci-cli, wee-slack. For more info: [snippets](https://git.picodevelopment.nl/explore/snippets) and [projects](https://git.picodevelopment.nl/explore/projects)

Aaron Bassett ([@aaronbassett](https://twitter.com/aaronbassett)) showed us some amazing (and probably illegal) things about SMS. [Here](https://speakerdeck.com/aaronbassett/stupid-and-possibly-illegal-stuff-you-can-do-with-sms-but-probably-shouldnt) you can find his slides. Really scary.

Two nice talks on our power as developers to shape the world. Let's do this right this time.
